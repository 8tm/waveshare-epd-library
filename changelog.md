## 0.0.3 - 2019/11/06
- Changed folder structure (matching the folder structure to the one generally adopted in Arduino libraries)
- Changed semantic versioning convention from 2 segments to 3 segments (This change may mislead, so it is better
  to acknowledge that previous versions did not exist and the project started from the current version 0.0.3)
